      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: [Date]</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for using Weatherofy! We respect your privacy and are
        committed to protecting any information we collect while providing this
        service. This policy outlines what information is collected, how it is
        used, and your rights regarding your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Data:</strong> With your permission, we collect
          geolocation data to provide accurate local weather information. This
          data is accessed in real-time and is not stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>City Input Data:</strong> When you enter a city name, we use
          this information only to fetch the weather data for that location.
          This input is not stored or shared.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use of Information</h2>
      <p>
        The data we collect is used solely to provide you with up-to-date
        weather information. We use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather
        data based on your geolocation or specified city. No data is stored,
        shared, or used for any other purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Geolocation:</strong> Allows the app to fetch weather data
          based on your current location, providing you with accurate local
          forecasts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Used to store your preferred settings,
          ensuring a personalized experience. No personal data is stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>activeTab:</strong> Ensures that Weatherofy operates smoothly
          by interacting with the current browser tab when needed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        This extension connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather
        information. No other third-party services are used, and no personal
        data is shared.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting the security of your information. Since
        we do not store any personal information, there is minimal risk
        associated with data breaches or leaks.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can control the data collected by managing permissions in your
        browser settings. You may choose to deny location access, although this
        may limit the functionality of the app.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted here, and we encourage you to review this page periodically for
        the latest information on our privacy practices.
      </p>
