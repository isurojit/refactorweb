      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>

        in the browser to extract relevant keywords.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        The extension uses the information extracted from the currently active
        tab to provide keyword extraction services. This information is
        processed locally and is not sent to any external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>

        policy.
